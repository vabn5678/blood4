            <p class="shortage">The shortage of blood has been a major public health problem in India. Presently, there
                is a
                huge gap between the demand and supply of blood. As per 2021 statistics, the demand and supply ratio was
                1.46 vs 1.25 crore units. In every two seconds, someone in India needs blood. It is estimated that over
                12,000 persons die every day in India due to non-availability of blood. One of the major factors for the
                shortfall is lack of awareness and prevalence of myths about blood donation. According to WHO, for every
                1,000 people in any country, at least 10-20 donors are required to provide adequate supplies. Regular
                blood
                donation is needed to ensure that blood is always available whenever required.</p>

            <p class="shortage">
                Unfortunately, in our country, many people who need transfusions do not have timely access to
                safe blood. The prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) including Hepatitis B
                virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV continues to remain high in India. WHO recommends
                that all blood donations should be screened for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis
                infections prior to use. In India, serological screening is mandatory for all donated blood for
                hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
                However, due to the window time for certain infections where the screening result can be falsely
                negative and the constant development of new variants, those who receive blood are still at risk
                of developing TTIs.

        Universal donor :
        Blood type O negative (O-) is the universal donor. This means that a person with any other blood type can safely
        receive your blood. It doesn’t contain any antigen markers that other blood types recognize as not belonging.
        Providers use type O negative blood the most in emergencies when someone needs blood fast.
    </div>
    <div class="rare">
        Universal recipient :
        Blood type AB positive (AB+) is the universal recipient. You can safely receive blood from any other blood type.
        Your blood recognizes all potential antigens as safe, so your immune system doesn’t launch an attack.
    </div>
    <div class="rare">
        Rare blood types :
        Outside of the ABO system, there are over 600 antigens that may attach to red blood cells. There are more than
        30 different blood group systems related to these unique antigens. Other blood group systems include the Duffy
        blood group,
        k antigen group, Lutheran blood group, kidd blood group.These blood groups are rare. A general definition of a
        rare blood type is one that happens at a rate of 1 per 1,000 people or fewer.
